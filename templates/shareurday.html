<h3>What is ShareUrDay?</h3>

<p class="p0"> ShareUrDay is an Android application which allows a user to create their own diary and sharing it with users of multi-nationals anonymously. One click of a button the user can create a diary message and share it on-line with other user’s across the world whom can reply, rate and report the diary message while not knowing this person's identity. The app would allow users to socialise while learning about new cultures (reading their diary messages), learning the different aspects of their lifestyle and would enhancely create relations for the public from adjacent races. ShareUrDay is simple, easy to use and effective.</p>

<h3>Why ShareUrDay?</h3>
<p class="p1">In the 19th century, we did not have any particular way to conserve the past other than on a piece of paper. The ongoing war has silenced us for over many centuries and when we do speak the truth, we wrote it on paper. The paper from which we wrote were secrets and pieces of fragments from oneself. When all the pages were put together, the book was known as a diary. There were many diaries in the 19th century but when technology took over, our data was stored elsewhere, in areas such as Facebook, Google and Instagram etc. Diaries were becoming less common and eventually forgottened.

Due to the increase of mobile applications,ShareUrDay was inspired to conserve a user's personal life journey from young to old and allows them to share their feelings and socialise at the same time while being anonymous to everybody else who uses ShareUrDay. </p>
